EVOL Car Rental System
Project Overview
This project is a database-driven system designed for EVOL (Electric Vehicles On Line), a company that provides electric vehicle rental services. The system manages customers, vehicles, and rentals, and facilitates online transactions. It is implemented using Java and JDBC to interact with a MySQL database. The system includes a user-friendly interface to handle operations such as vehicle search, rental transactions, and report generation.

Key Features
User Registration: Customers can register by providing personal details, driving license, and credit card information.
Vehicle Management: Supports management of different types of vehicles (cars, bikes, scooters) with attributes like brand, model, color, autonomy, and rental costs.
Rental Transactions: Allows customers to rent vehicles, select drivers, make payments, and return vehicles.
Reports: Generates detailed reports about rentals, vehicle availability, and revenue.
System Requirements
Java 8+
MySQL 5.7+
JDBC Driver for MySQL
HTML/PHP or Java Command Line for the user interface
Optional: Java Swing or Java Servlets for GUI implementation (BONUS 10%).

Database Design
The system includes multiple database tables to store details about vehicles, customers, and rental transactions. Below is a high-level overview of the entities and their relationships.

Key Entities:
Vehicles: Stores information about cars, bikes, scooters, etc.
Attributes: Vehicle ID, brand, model, color, autonomy, type, daily rental cost, and insurance cost.
Customers: Stores customer details.
Attributes: Customer ID, name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, credit card details.
Rentals: Stores rental transactions.
Attributes: Rental ID, customer ID, vehicle ID, rental date, return date, payment amount.
SQL Schema
The evol.sql script located in src/main/resources/db/ contains:

Table creation commands for customers, vehicles, and rentals.
Sample data inserts for initial testing.
```sql

CREATE TABLE vehicles (
  Color VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  idVehicle INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Category ENUM('car','motorcycles','bicycle','scooter') NOT NULL,
  Cost INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  Driver VARCHAR(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  Availability INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',
  HasInsurance TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  Damaged TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  InsuranceCost INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '20',
  DaysToFix INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  RentCounter INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (idVehicle),
  UNIQUE KEY `Vehicle_ID_UNIQUE` (idVehicle)
);
```
Features and Functionality
1. User Registration
Description: Users register by providing personal details, driver's license information (if required), and credit card details.
Validations:
Users must be at least 18 years old for renting cars or motorbikes.
Users must be at least 16 years old for renting bikes or scooters.
2. Vehicle Management
Description: Manage vehicle availability and details. The system supports four categories of vehicles: cars, motorbikes, bicycles, and scooters.
Data Tracked:
Brand, model, type (SUV, sedan, etc.), number of passengers (for cars), color, autonomy, daily rental and insurance cost.
3. Rental Management
Description: Customers can rent one or more vehicles at a time. Each vehicle must have a unique driver, and payments are processed using credit cards.
Rental Features:
Set rental dates, calculate costs, apply penalties for late returns, handle damage reports, and manage vehicle replacements in case of accidents.
4. Reports
The system generates reports such as:
Available or rented vehicles by category.
Rental history by time period.
Maximum, minimum, and average rental durations.
Revenue generated by time period and vehicle category.
Maintenance and repair costs by time period.
Most popular vehicles in each category.
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
Java: Ensure Java is installed and properly set up in your system.
MySQL: Install MySQL and set up a database for the EVOL system.
JDBC Driver: Ensure you have the JDBC driver for MySQL in your classpath.
Steps:
Set Up the Database:

Import the SQL schema and sample data into your MySQL database:
```bash

mysql -u username -p evol_database < src/main/resources/db/evol.sql
```
Configure Database Connection:

Modify the DatabaseManager.java file to include your MySQL credentials:
```java

String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/evol_database";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";
```
Compile the Java Code:

If you're using Maven, you can build the project using:
```bash

mvn clean install
```
Or you can compile it directly using javac:
```bash

javac -cp ".:mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar" src/main/java/evol/*.java
```
Run the Program:

Execute the main class:
```bash

java -cp ".:mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar" evol.App
```
Interact with the System:

Depending on your chosen interface (command line, HTML, or PHP), you can now interact with the system to register customers, rent vehicles, and generate reports.
Input Data Examples
Here are sample SQL insert commands to populate the database:

Sample Data for Vehicles
```sql

INSERT INTO vehicles (Color, idVehicle, Category, Cost, Driver, Availability, HasInsurance, Damaged, InsuranceCost, DaysToFix, RentCounter) VALUES
('Red', 1, 'car', 10000, NULL, 1, 0, 0, 1000, 0, 0),
('Blue', 2, 'car', 15000, NULL, 1, 0, 0, 1000, 0, 0),
('Green', 3, 'car', 12000, NULL, 1, 0, 0, 1000, 0, 0),
('Yellow', 4, 'car', 13000, NULL, 1, 0, 0, 1000, 0, 0);
```

Sample Data for Customers
```sql

INSERT INTO customer (idCustomer, NameLastName, Address, CardNumber, BirthDate, LicenceNumber, Password, UserName) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '123 Main St', '4111111111111111', '1985-07-12', 'D123456', 'password123', 'johndoe'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '456 Elm St', '4222222222222222', '1990-02-25', 'D654321', 'password456', 'janesmith');
```
Sample Data for Rentals
```sql

INSERT INTO rentals (idRental, NameCustomer, Date, Price, idVehicle, idCustomer, Duration) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '2024-01-01', 100, 1, 1, '2 days'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '2024-01-03', 200, 2, 2, '3 days');
```
Future Improvements
Implement a complete graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or Java Servlets for a more user-friendly experience.
Enhance the payment system to support multiple payment gateways.
Introduce real-time notifications and tracking for vehicle availability and customer rentals.
